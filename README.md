> a haskell script to play terry riley in c with tidal cycle

In my recurring obsession to play Terry Riley’s In C, I made a first attempt with a guitar and six amplifiers. Being an algorithmic composition (53 patterns of various lengths), I thought of Tidal Cycles as a perfect platform for another attempt to render this iconic piece.

I wrote the code and recorded myself “playing” it with the “show us your screen” mantra of live coders.

    Is in C in C ? In Haskell ? In Tidal ?
